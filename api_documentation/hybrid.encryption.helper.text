Hybrid Encryption Implementation:

AES Key Generation: A random AES key and initialization vector (IV) are generated.
Data Encryption: The data is encrypted using AES with the generated key and IV.
AES Key Encryption: The AES key is encrypted using the RSA public key.
Return Encrypted Package: The function returns an object containing the IV, encrypted data, and encrypted AES key.
Hybrid Decryption Implementation:

AES Key Decryption: The AES key is decrypted using the RSA private key.
Data Decryption: The encrypted data is decrypted using the decrypted AES key and IV.
Environment Variables and File Reading:

Public and private keys are read from environment variables or files.
Key Generation and Verification:

RSA key pair generation and file saving.
Verification of key existence and generation if necessary.
Digital Signature and Hash Functions:

Functions for signing data, verifying signatures, generating hashes, and creating cryptographically secure random strings.
